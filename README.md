VecbosApp
=========

This is an umbrella application for most analyses running off the vecbos nTuples.  

To run simply clone this directory and do "source compile.src" in the VecbosApp folder.  
If you can only connect to github through https (on the Caltech T3, for example), then do "compile.src.http" instead.

This will clone additional necessary repositories from github and compile the various parts of the package.
For help, please contact any of the package owners.
